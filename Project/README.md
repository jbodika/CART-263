## Description

Astral Exploration is an exploration of humanity through the eyes of an extraterrestrial life force, that incorporates wacky, ironic mini-games. Each game playfully analyzes human behaviour, questioning what it truly means to be "human" through unexpected commentary and absurd challenges.

You must help a fellow alien navigate this bizarre world by collecting clues, deciphering historical imagery, and piecing together what makes humans.. well human! To help them find the way back to their ship. Whether you mimic human interactions or fail horribly at blending in, every mini-game adds a new layer of satire and discovery.

Will you crack the code of humanity, or will your alien friend remain forever lost on Earth?
